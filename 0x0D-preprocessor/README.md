# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

The preprocessor in C is a tool that performs certain text manipulations on the source code before it's actually compiled. Its primary purpose is to prepare the code for compilation by performing tasks like including header files, defining macros, and conditional compilation.
Key functions of the preprocessor include:
1.	File Inclusion: The #include directive is used to include the contents of another file into the current file. This is commonly used to include header files that contain function prototypes and macro definitions.
2.	Macro Definition: Macros are defined using the #define directive. They are used to define constants, small functions, or code snippets that can be replaced throughout the code by the preprocessor before compilation.
3.	Conditional Compilation: The preprocessor allows you to include or exclude certain sections of code based on conditions. This is achieved using directives like #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif, #elif, etc.
4.	Macro Expansion: The preprocessor replaces macros with their defined values throughout the code. This is known as macro expansion.
5.	Stringizing Operator: The # operator can be used to convert macro parameters into string literals.
6.	Token Pasting Operator: The ## operator can be used to concatenate tokens during macro expansion.
7.	Pragma Directives: Pragma directives provide compiler-specific instructions or control over certain aspects of the compilation process.
8.	Undefining Macros: The #undef directive is used to remove a macro definition.
The preprocessor runs before the actual compilation and transforms the source code according to the directives and macros defined in it. The transformed code is then passed to the compiler for further processing and generation of object code
